I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

I'm vanilla, baby
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killa, baby
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby
I get love in Detroit like Skilla, baby
And the thing about ya boy is
I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

Young J-A-cock AKA Rico like Suave, Young Enrique
Speakin' of AKA, she's a Alpha
But not around ya boy
She get quiet 'round ya boy, hold on
Don't know what you heard or what you thought about ya boy
But they lied about ya boy
Goin' dumb, man, it's some idiotic 'bout ya boy
She wearin' cheetah print
That's how bad she wanna be spotted 'round ya boy

I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me
I'm vanilla, baby
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killa, baby
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby
I get love in Detroit like Skilla, baby
And the thing about ya boy is
I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

Young M-I-S-S-I-O-N-A-R-Y
He's sharp like barbed wire
She stole my heart then she got archived
I keep it short with a bitch, Lord Farquaad

All the girls in the front row
All the girls at the barricade
All the girls that been waitin' all day
Let your tongue hang out
Fuck everything
If you came with a man
Let go of his hand
Everybody in a suite, kickin' up they feet
Stand up, bitch, dance

And all the guys in the back waitin' on the next track
Cut ya boy a little slack
It's young Jack

I'm vanilla, baby
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killa, baby
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby
I get love in Detroit like Skilla, baby
And the thing about ya boy is
I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby
I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby
