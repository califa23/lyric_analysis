Kissing and hope they caught us
Whether they like it or not
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna brag about it, I wanna tie the knot
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you, yeah, yeah
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you, yeah, yeah
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you
Hold my hand
You can hit while they watch, boy

So, 9:30?
I'll see you there
No, you hang up
You hang up

Some different about you
Love it when he hit and smack too
Baby, lemme lick on your tattoos
That's true, that I like PDA
Take you to a seedy place
Suck a little dick in the bathroom
Who that man with the big strong hands
On her ass in the club with the paps? Baby, that's you
Front-seat chillin' with the window down
I be ten toes down on the dash getting' fast food

Hope you can handle the heat
Put your name in the streets
Get used to my fans looking at you
Fuck what they heard, I don't fuck with them birds
I'm a mean kitty, don't get stabbed with the rat tooth
Boys be mad that I don't fuck incels
Girls hate too
Gun to their pigtail, I love you
I want a big chill, boy, don't trip
I'll split a big bill

Take you 'round the world
They don't have to understand
Rub it in their face
Put a rock on her hand

Baby, can you call me back? I miss you
It's so lonely in my mansion

Kissing and hope they caught us
Whether they like it or not
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna brag about it, I wanna tie the knot
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you, yeah, yeah
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you, yeah, yeah
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you
Hold my hand
You can hit while they watch, boy

Sorry, I was taking a sip of my root beer

'Cause love is pain but I need this shit
We fuck too good when the bean kicks in
Like Fortnite, I'ma need your skin
Don't give a fuck where the penis been
Boy, you're the one, you're the only man
Me and you on my OnlyFans
Holy cow, you're the Holy Trin
Hold me down, when a hole need dick

Be my security, it's your therapy
With you I ain't holding shit back
When I need my space, you give that
When he broke my heart, you fixed that
With a long walk on the beach
Love it when they honk-honk on the street
When they see us zoom by in the Jeep
We a whole damn joint, we an energy
Baby, we could just ride on our enemies
They all wanna know how you get to me
Let 'em feel how they feel and be Philistines
'Cause this type of love's the epitome
Said

Baby, you're literally capping to me right now
Like, why are you capping?
You just cap so hard, it's
I don't know what to do

Kissing and hope they caught us
Whether they like it or not
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna brag about it, I wanna tie the knot
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you, yeah, yeah
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you, yeah, yeah
I wanna show you off, I wanna show you off
I wanna show you
Hold my hand
You can hit while they watch, boy
